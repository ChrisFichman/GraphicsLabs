Completion Time: 
This assignment took me roughly 7 hours to complete, I got hung up on
ordering my verticies correctly, but the more I messed arround, the 
better organization became, and the TIE-fighter was far quicker in the
making than the X-Wing because of this. 

I wanted to maintain the functionality of the x-wing (with vectors for
orientation) for the tie fighter, but couldn't figure out how to do it 
in conjunction with scaling (without having 12 variables passed into the
function)
